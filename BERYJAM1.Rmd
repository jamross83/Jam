## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r BER}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r JAM}
croc <- read.csv("crocodile_dataset.csv")
data.frame(croc)

ages <- c("Hatchling", "Juvenile", "Subadult", "Adult")
ageorder<- factor(croc$Age.Class, levels = ages)


"Observed Length (m)" <- croc$Observed.Length..m.

ggplot(croc, aes(x = Genus, y = ageorder, fill = `Observed Length (m)`)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "dark green") +
  xlab("Crocodile Genus")+
  ylab("Age Estimate")+
  ggtitle("Crocodile Observed Lengths per age within Genus") +
  theme_bw()

```

```{r}

croc <- read.csv("crocodile_dataset.csv")
data.frame(croc)

ages <- c("Hatchling", "Juvenile", "Subadult", "Adult")
ageorder <- factor(croc$Age.Class, levels = ages)

for (g in unique(croc$Genus)) {
  avg_length <- mean(croc$Observed.Length..m.[croc$Genus == g], na.rm = TRUE)
  print(paste("Average observed length for", g, ":", round(avg_length, 2), "m"))}

ggplot(croc, aes(x = Genus, y = ageorder, fill = Observed.Length..m.)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "dark green") +
  xlab("Crocodile Genus") +
  ylab("Age Estimate") +
  ggtitle("Crocodile Observed Lengths per Age within Genus") +
  theme_bw()





```
^ idk if this is right james but i addded the loop and it seems to run, but i feel like the graph looks off, lmk what u think 




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
