#TITLE OF PROJECT:
#Crocodile Observations

#USERS: James Ross and Berenice Gonzalez

#SUMMARY:
# For our project, we worked with a dataset containing information on crocodile genera, age classes, and observed lengths. We organized the age groups, which were the Hatchling, Juvenile, Subadult, Adult age groups and added a loop with three elements representing the three genera in the dataset. Inside the loop, we used a conditional statement to print the average observed length for each type of crocodile, categorizing them as large, medium, or small based on their average size. We then created a ggplot2 heatmap to visualize the observed lengths across different age classes and genera, using a color gradient to highlight size differences. This allowed us to both analyze and visually compare crocodile growth patterns among species. After receiving feedback on our draft, we added two control elements that contribute directly to a second visualization. In this improved figure, we used an ifelse statement to assign a numerical size score (1, 2, or 3) depending on the crocodile’s observed length. We then incorporated this new variable into a second heatmap that again showcases crocodile size per age within each genus. These additions ensure that our control structures directly influence the visualizations, creating clearer and more meaningful results.

#OVERVIEW:
#In our project, we ended up using a for loop and conditional if statement to portray the observed lengths of crocodiles based on age and species. Upon recieving feedback for our draft submission, we added an additional graph that portrays Crocodile sizes per age within each genus that shows the sizes of each crocodile, with 3 being a larger crocodile and 1 being the smallest. 

#INSTRUCTIONS:
#In order to run the data smoothly, use the github repository link and run the entire RMD file at the start. This will load in the libraries we used as well as allow users to view the graphs created. The first R code shows an original graph of the data which we used as a reference before including the conditional and loop aspects in the project 2 draft section.
